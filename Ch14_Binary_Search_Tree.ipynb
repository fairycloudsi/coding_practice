Furthermore, if an inorder traversal of a binary tree visits keys in sorted order, then that binary tree must be a BST.

Thus we can check the BST property by performing an inorder traversal, recording the key stored at the last visited node. Each time a new node is visited, its key s compared with the key of the previously visited node. If at any step in the walk, the key at the previoulsy visited node is greater than the node currently being visited, we have a violation of the BST property. \n",

Otherwise, we add its children along with the corresponding constraint. \n",

This is also true for preorder and postorder traversals. Given the sequence of nodes that an inorder traversal sequence visits and either of the other two traversal sequences, there exists a unique binary tree that yields those sequences. Here we study if it is possible to reconstruct the tree with less traversal information when the tree is known as BST. \n",

    "However, the story for a preorder sequence is different. As an example, consider the preorder key sequence <43,23,37,29,31,41,47,53>. The root must hold 43, since it is the first visited node. The left subtree contains keys less than 43, i.e. 23, 37, 29, 31, 41, and the right subtree contains keys greater than 43, i.e., 47, 53. Furthermore, <23,37,29,31,41> ix exactly the preorder sequence of the left subtree and <47,53> is exactly the preorder sequence for the right subtree. We can recursively reason that 23 and 47 are the roots of the left and right subtree, and continue to build the entire tree, which is exactly the subtree rooted at Node I in Figure 14.1."
