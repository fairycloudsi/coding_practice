Furthermore, if an inorder traversal of a binary tree visits keys in sorted order, then that binary tree must be a BST.

Thus we can check the BST property by performing an inorder traversal, recording the key stored at the last visited node. Each time a new node is visited, its key s compared with the key of the previously visited node. If at any step in the walk, the key at the previoulsy visited node is greater than the node currently being visited, we have a violation of the BST property. \n",

Otherwise, we add its children along with the corresponding constraint. \n",

The left subtree contains keys less than 43, i.e. 23, 37, 29, 31, 41, and the right subtree contains keys greater than 43, i.e., 47, 53. Furthermore, <23,37,29,31,41> ix exactly the preorder sequence of the left subtree and <47,53> is exactly the preorder sequence for the right subtree.

A better approach is to reconstruct the left subtree in the same iteration as identifying the nodes which lie in it. The code shown below takes this approach. The intuition is that we do not want to iterate from first entry after the root to the last entry smaller than the root, not to go back and partially repeat this process for the root's left subtree. We can avoid repeated passes over nodes by inducing the range of keys we want to reconstruct the subtrees over. For example, looking at preorder key sequence <43,23,37,29,31,41,47,53>, instead of recursing on <23,37,29,31,41> (which would involve an iteration to get the last element in this sequence).

More formally, balance can be achieved by keeping the number of nodes in both subtrees as close as possible. \n",
