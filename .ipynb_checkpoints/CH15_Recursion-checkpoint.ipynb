    "Recursion is an approach to problem solving where the solution depends partially on solutions to smaller instances of related problems. It is often appropriate when the input is expressed using recursive rules, such as a computer grammar. More generally, searching, enumeration, divide-and-conquer, and decomposing a complex problem into a set of similar smaller instances are all scenarios where recursion maybe suitable. \n",

    "A recursive functio consists of base cases and calls to the same function with different arguments. Two key ingredients to a successful use of recursion are identifying the base cases, which are to be solved directly, and ensuring progress, that is the recursion converges to the solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "A divide-and-conquer algorithm works by repeatedly decomposing a problem into two or more smaller independent subproblems of the same kind, until it gets to instances that are simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the subproblems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem. Merge sort and quicksort are classical examples of divide-and-conquer. \n",

    "Divide-and-conquer is not synonymous with recursion. In divide-and-conquer, the problem is divided into two or more independent smaller problems that are of the same type as the original problem. Recursion is more general--there may be a single subproblem, e.g., binary search, the subproblems may not be independent, e.g., dynamic programming, and they may not be of the same type as the original, e.g., regular expression matching. In addition, sometimes to improve runtime, and occasionally to reduce space complexity, a divide-and-conquer algorithm is implemented using iteration instead of recursion. "
