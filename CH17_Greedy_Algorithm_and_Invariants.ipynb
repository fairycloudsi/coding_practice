    "\n",
    "Given an instance of the gasup problem, how would you efficiently compute an ample city? You can assume that there exists an ample city. The input is given in the form of two arrays --one for the amount of gas at each city, the other for the distance to the next city.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Think about starting with more than enough gas to complete the circuit without gassing up. Track the amount of gas as you perform the circuit, gassing up at each city. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sol:** Consider a city where the amount of gas in the tank is minimum when we enter that city. Observe that it does not depend where we begin from--because graphs are the same up to translation and shifting, a city that is minimum for one graph will be a minimum city for all graphs. Let z be a city where the amount of gas in the tank before we refuel at the city is minimum. Now we pick z as the starting point, with the gas present at z. Since we never have less gas than we started with at z, and when we return to z we have 0 gas (since it's given that the total amount of gas is just enough to complete the traversal) it means we can complete the journey without running out of gas. Note that the reasoning given above assumes that there always exists an ample city. \n",
    "\n",
    "The computation to determine z can be easily performed with a single pass over all the cities simulating the changes to amount of gas as we advance. "

Althouhg for some buildings, we may perform multiple pops, in total we perform at most n pushes and at most n pops. This is because in the advancing phase, an entry i is added at most once to the stack and cannot be popped more than once. The time complexity of processing remaining stack elements after the advancing is complete is also O(n) since there are at most n elements in the stack, and the time to process each one is O(1). Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n). The space compelxity is O(n), which is the largest the stack can grow to, e.g., if buldings appear in ascending order. "
